=============

In order for bios-supermicro-configure to function, Rebar needs to have an available
copy of SuperMicro Update Manager present.  We currently support running with
sum 1.6.0, which should be placed at ``digitalrebar/deploy/compose/config-dir/tools``
before starting the Rebar API container.
