Vagrant and  Digital Rebar
==========================

Note: While workable, this is not our suggested path for building an admin node!  It works better for added nodes.

The Vagrant install uses the `rebar cli <../cli/README.rst>`_ for actions.  It must be accessible from your Vagrant path.

Admin Node
----------

We recommend using the Docker tools directly to bring up an Admin node!

``vagrant up base``

Workload Nodes
--------------

``vagrant up node1``
