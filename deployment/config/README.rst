Pre-Install Configuration
-------------------------

There are a set of configuration options that can be set before running the deploy tools.  These modify the start up and options available in the running Digital Rebar admin server.  Many of these options and values can be modified post deployment. However, it is easier to set configurations initially, therefore allowing for more simple rebuilding and development in the future.
