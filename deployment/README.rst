Deployment Guide
----------------

This guide contains information on how to deploy and setup a Digital Rebar environment.  Once setup, next steps can be found
in the :ref:`user_guide`.

The deployment guide provides four parts:

#. Deciding what and where to deploy
#. Getting the deployment tools
#. Tweaking configuration for initial bring up and beyond
#. Running tools to do deployment

Walk through each section to get deploy a Digital Rebar admin node or as always ``tl;dr`` :ref:`quick_start`.
