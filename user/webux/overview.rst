===============

At Digital Rebar, we not only strive to provide excellent deployment services, but an excellent user experience.  In order to satisfy that imperative, we have developed a new user interface.  
The new interface provides a sleek new way to interact with server deployment, and has been designed with efficiency in mind.  


General
-------

Upon logging in, the user interface will open to the Deployments page. At the top right of the page are two icons and a word. The word, which is `system` by default, displays the current tenant being used. By clicking on the word, the tenant can be changed through a drop down menu.



NOTE: If the user was created in a tenant other than system, the other tenant name will be dispayed.
