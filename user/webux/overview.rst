Overview
========

At Digital Rebar, we strive to provide not just excellent deployment services, but an excellent user experience.  In order to satisfy that imperative, we have developed a new user interface.
The new interface provides a sleek, new way to interact with server deploymen is designed with efficiency in mind.


General
-------

Upon logging in, the user interface will open to the Deployments page. The top of every page is dominated by this header:

The name of the selected page is posted on the left, while the tenant is displayed to the right.
The two icons are for refreshing data and viewing the :ref:`_ux_annealer` respectively. Thanks to the data refresher, users should not need to refresh the page.
