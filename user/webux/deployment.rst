===========

This page displays the deployments in progress, the nodes involved in the deployments, the roles applied to the nodes, the progress of node deployment, and the presence of errors.

Deployments Bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments can be seen below the header as a bar with the deployment name, a circular progress meter, and a drop down tab.

**Note:** Nodes can be opened by simply clicking on their icon. To return from looking at the node press the link next to "development" in the node view.

Beneath the node icons, there are three buttons: Propose, Add Node, and Bind Node Roles.
These can be used to add new roles, add new nodes, and bind roles to nodes respectively.

**Note:** When Propose is opened two new icons will appear "add role" and "commit" these are used to add a role, and then save the new role to the deployment.
