**Note:** Nodes can be opened by simply clicking on their icon; to return from looking at the node press the link next to "development" in the node view.

Beneath the node icons, the three buttons are: Propose, Add Node, and Bind Node Roles.
These can be used to add new roles, add new nodes, and bind roles to nodes.

**Note:** When Propose is opened two new icons will appear "add role" and "commit" these are used to add a role, and then save the new role to the deployment.
