DNS Zones
=========

The "DNS Zones" page displays the current DNS Zones.
This maps the space from names to IP addresses and back.
The Zone shows the current map that Digital Rebar is making on behalf of nodes.
This includes IPv4 A records and IPv6 AAAA records.


**Note:** By default, only the admin network has entries created.
