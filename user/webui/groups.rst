Groups
======

Groups have no programmatic Digital Rebar function.  They allow operators to create arbitrary grouping outside of the Digital Rebar control mechanism (:ref:`webui_deployment`).  Examples of group types include Rack and UI.

Adding Groups
-------------

Groups are added by using the "new item!" field and button in the top right of the groups list.

----------------------

Nodes are added to a group by clicking the (+) in front of the node name while on that group.
