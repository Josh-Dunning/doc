Operation
---------

The Ready State Wizard performs multiple steps for provisioning
discovered nodes from a single screen. This convenience eliminates
several steps that are commonly performed together.

From the Ready State Wizard Screen: 

  1. name the deployment (network will be named the same as the deployment) 
  #. describe the network settings (you can change this later from the Networks page) 
  #. check the nodes that you want to provision 
  #. select the o/s that you want to be installed 
  #. accept the changes (this takes you to the deployment page)
  #. commit the deployment to begin.
