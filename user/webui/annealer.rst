Annealer
========

The Annealer page (/annealer) shows all the active node-roles (see :ref:`ui_roles`) in the system grouped by type with the most immediate types (error, transition) at the top.  The Annealer can be reached by Monitor...Annealer or the top right status icons.

Operation
---------

The Annealer page is primarily read-only and automatically refreshes.  As the system changes, node-role status is displayed for each role-role.

For any roles in error, a retry button and retry-all button is provided.
