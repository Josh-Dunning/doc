Welcome to Digital Rebar Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Digital Rebar Project** is a container-ready hardware provisioning platform that delivers the best of software deployment automation and orchestration without locking you into a single hardware platform or operating system.  Our mission is to embrace the heterogenous nature of data center operations.

While it's been completly rebuilt by DevOps artisans, Digital Rebar history includes years of battle-tested ops learnings by the `Crowbar Project <http://github.com/crowbar>`_ founders.

Exec Summary
------------

The principal motivation for creation of Digital Rebar is the transition a
from bare metal installer into a tool that manages ongoing operations.
Digital Rebar enables upgrade and continuous deployment automation. This
capability is important for large scale deployments of evolving complex
projects like OpenStack, Hadoop, and Ceph.

Digital Rebar provides the foundation for operations automation.
Digital Rebar is an open reference implementation that can be reliably
deployed in large-scale, multi-site datacenters. This effectively
productizes best practices in a way that allows creation of consistent
and discoverable operating environments. Users benefit with fast
time-to-value and we benefit by having consistent installations across
the ecosystem.

Benefits of Digital Rebar
-------------------------

Digital Rebar reduces the cost of datacenter hardware infrastructure
preparation. The immediate benefits of Digital Rebar are realized in the
deployment of complex compute and storage clusters. Digital Rebar reduces
the human resource cost of getting compute platform systems into
productive use, automates continuous hardware redeployment, automates
hypervisor, operating systems, and application layer software
installation and management. All of these add up to significant gains in
operational reliability, consistency, and concomitant reduction in
defects handling costs.
