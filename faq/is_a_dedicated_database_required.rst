Is a Dedicated Database Server Required?
========================================

As of July 2016, we stand up our own Postgres 9.5 database to use as a backing store for Rebar and Goiardi (the built-in Chef server we use).  There is nothing preventing us from using other servers (if one is avalible for this sort of thing) but a bit of config work.
