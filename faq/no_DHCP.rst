Why did Digital Rebar not start DHCP?
=====================================

The DHCP/PXE process is optional for Digital Rebar, thus it must be requested at system start to be functional. 

**Note**: At least one ISO must be provided for the provisioner to convert into install images.  The discovery images (aka Sledgehammer) is downloaded automatically by the provisioner.
